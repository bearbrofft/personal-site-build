    <p class="intro">Hi! My name is Bear Brofft and I am a rising senior at Babson College. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's 
        of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics. Outside of my coursework, 
        I am very passionate about coding and am currently pursuing a Professional Certification in Codecademy's 
        Full-Stack Engineer career path. This site is dedicated to storing my personal projects and providing background
